Contoso Conf.
A conference web app.

User stories
As a user, I want to be able to list all the conference tracks, all the sessions and all the speakers in three different pages (displays)
feel free to user your own imagination here: either create separate pages, or create a single dynamic page with filters.
As a user, I want to add a session to my schedule. Once added, the amount of seats available for that session has to decrease. As soon as no seats are left, the session can no longer be booked and the "Reserve seat" button is disabled.
Acceptance criteria
Use Bootstrap (pick your fav. version) for the grid system and overall design of the app.
The application has to be responsive (automatically adjusts the UI based on the screen size).
Read the conference data (sessions, speakers, tracks etc.) from a JSON file.
Persist attendance to sessions (per session) in local storage. For extra points:
Because sessions take place all around the world, list the sessions closest to my physical location.
step 1: bootstrap site step 2: valid json file step 3: read that file
